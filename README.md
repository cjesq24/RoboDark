# README

A dark theme with enhanced syntax highlighting for JavaScript. Scope highlighting along with bold and italic fonts make it easy to identify your code and visualize its structure. It supports:

- JavaScript

- HTML

- CSS

- SCSS/SASS

- Python

- Markdown

- REACT

- Pug

 Where it stands out though? JavaSscript. It is built to display the code's structure so it stands out. It even provides different colors based on the scope; so it is helpful to identify the porogression of your code. Feel free to fork and add to it.

Its clean and stylish design is easy on the eyes. Inspired by Umut TopuzoÄŸlu's Bluloco Dark Theme, RoboDark builds upon the great Bluloco color palette to create a better user experience.

Hope you enjoy.
