# README

A dark theme with enhanced syntax highlighting for JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It's not just visually appealing but practical as well. The scoped syntax makes it easy to identify your code and visualize its structure. RoboDark offers a broad spectrum of magic colors beautifully contrasted with the dark theme behind it. It supports:

- JavaScript

- HTML

- CSS

- SCSS/SASS

- Python

- Markdown

- REACT

- Pug

 Where it stands out though? JavaScript. For instance, a method is colored differently than a function, which is colored differenbtly than a DOM method. RoboDark was created for JavaScript scoped syntax highlighting. It features Multi-colored punctuation, which is great for focusing on the bigger picture without loosing sight of the details.

Its clean and stylish design is easy on the eyes. Inspired by Umut TopuzoÄŸlu's Bluloco Dark Theme, RoboDark builds upon the great Bluloco color palette to create a better user experience.The colors are nice, but its scoped syntax highlighting is even nicer! Feel free to fork.

Hope you enjoy!
