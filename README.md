# README

A dark theme with enhanced syntax highlighting for JavaScript. Scope highlighting along with bold and italic fonts make it easy to identify your code and visualize its structure. It supports:

                            $ JavaScript
                            
                            $ HTML
                            
                            $ CSS
                            
                            $ SCSS
                            
                            $ Python
                            
                            $ Markdown
                            
                            $ Vue
                            
                            $ REACT
                            
 Where it stands out though? JavaSscript. It is built to display your code structure in an easily vusable style. Feel free to fork and add to it.
                            
Its clean and stylish design is easy on the eyes. Inspired by Umut TopuzoÄŸlu's Bluloco Dark Theme, RoboDark builds upon the great Bluloco color palette to create a better user experience.
